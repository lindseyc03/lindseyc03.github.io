He enjoys candy and toys.  Despite his childlike nature, however, he's a very powerful Oricha.  He's one of the Warriors (along with Ogún, Ochosi and Osun).  Eleguá is always mentioned first in any ceremony, because without his permission, the doors to communication with the other Orichas stay closed. ",

He knows the secrets of the natural world and can perform powerful witchcraft when the situation calls for it.  He has a violent, brusque nature, but he also has a more peaceful side. He's good at farming, raising animals and hunting.  Ogún is also the owners of keys and locks, jails, and chains, and he's the foundation on which everything is built.  He oversees construction and labor, and is the master of the technology required for human progress and evolution in the material world. In traditional images of Ogún, he wears a close-fitting cap on his head, his chest is bare, he wears a hunter's pouch slung across a shoulder, and around his waist he wears a belt with a long fringe of mariwó (palm fibers), which protects him from evil.",
        "Together with Eleguá and Ochosi, he protects the interior entryway of homes."
