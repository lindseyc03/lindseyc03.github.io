      text: ["Eleguá (Elegguá) is a powerful Oricha who represents both the beginning and end of life, appearing as either a child or an old man. Known as the Lord of the Crossroads and one of the Warriors, he controls the opening and closing of paths in life and must be mentioned first in ceremonies to communicate with other Orichas. His sacred colors are red and black, his number is 3, and he is honored on Mondays and the 3rd day of each month, with feast days on January 6 and June 13. In Catholic syncretism, he is associated with the Child Jesus of Atocha, Saint Anthony of Padua, and Anima Sola. Eleguá is traditionally represented by a stone shaped into a head with cowrie shells for eyes and mouth, kept behind doors in a clay dish, and he favors offerings of children's toys, candy, cigars, cooking wine, and specific foods like toasted corn and smoked meats."

Known as the Lord of Metals and divine blacksmith, he is the patron of all who work with metal - mechanics, engineers, soldiers, and surgeons. He dwells in the forest and was tasked with clearing paths with his machete when the Orichas came to earth. His days are Tuesday and Wednesday, and the 4th day of each month, with his feast day on June 29. In Catholic syncretism, he is primarily associated with Saint Peter (due to Peter's ownership of keys), and also Saint Paul, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Michael, and Saint Rafael. Ogún is traditionally represented wearing a close-fitting cap, bare-chested, with a hunter's pouch and a belt of protective palm fibers (mariwó). He dwells in a three-legged metal cauldron alongside Ochosi, and together with Elegua and Osun, they form the Guerreros (Warriors). He favors offerings of roasted sweet potatoes, plantains, white beans, palm oil, and cigars, often left at railroad tracks, one of his symbols."],

Ochosi dwells in an iron cauldron with Ogun near the entryway of homes, and together with Elegua and Osun, they form the Warriors (Guerreros). He is traditionally represented by a crossbow and arrow, and his tools include three arrows, three hunting dogs, a small mirror, a stag's horn, and a fishing hook. He protects wildlife, especially hunting birds like falcons and hawks, and watches over those who work with dogs. His eleke (sacred necklace) consists of blue and yellow beads, sometimes incorporating green, coral, or amber. Those seeking justice must come to him with pure intentions, and his offerings are often left at courthouses and jails."],

Her sacred colors are yellow and gold, her number is 5, and she is honored on Saturdays and the 5th day of each month, with her feast day on September 8. In Catholic syncretism, she is associated with Our Lady of Charity (La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre), the patroness of Cuba. Oshún is traditionally depicted wearing flowing yellow satin dresses with jingling bells, adorned with gold jewelry, and she favors offerings of honey, perfumes (especially vetiver and sandalwood), mirrors, fans, sunflowers, and all manner of sweet things. Both the peacock and vulture are her sacred symbols, representing her beauty and bravery in flying to heaven to help solve the Orichas' problems on Earth.
